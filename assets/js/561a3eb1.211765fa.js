In a single-spa world, your SPA contains many registered applications, where each has its own framework. Registered applications have their own client-side routing and their own frameworks/libraries. They render their own HTML and have full freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they are mounted. The concept of being mounted refers to whether a registered application is putting content on the DOM or not. What determines if a registered application is mounted is its activity function. Whenever a registered application is not mounted, it should remain completely dormant until mounted.","sidebar":"version-5.x/docs"},"code-of-conduct":{"id":"code-of-conduct","title":"Code of Conduct","description":"This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the single-spa community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior.
